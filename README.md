### Project Description
This project is a challenge given by a partner of BeCode, Accenture. The purpose of the app is to determine whether the employee is eligible for the FMB (Federal Mobility Budget).

#### Employee Side:
- Declare whether they worked on a given day.
- Select their work location for that day from a list of official addresses.
- Determine from which address the employee worked most of the month.
- Determine the geographical coordinates of the declared home address and the most worked from workplace address.
- Calculate the 'as-the-crow-flies' distance between the home address and the most worked from workplace address.
- Assess whether the distance between the two is within a 10 km range. (not eligible if > 10km)
- Determine if the employee is eligible for the FMB based on their monthly work location data.
- Keep a record of these details for each month for audit and tracking purposes.

#### HR Department's Perspective:
- Enable HR personnel to add and manage a list of official client locations and addresses.
- Allow HR to monitor which employees are enrolled in the program.
- Provide the ability to view the history of any employee's monthly declarations to facilitate auditing and record-keeping. (This is achieved by clicking on an employee from the Employee list)
